# 01 â€” Introduction to Microfrontends

Microfrontends extend the concept of microservices to the frontend. Instead of one big SPA, you break the UI into smaller, independently deployable pieces owned by different teams.

### Why use Microfrontends?

- Large teams working on the same app
- Independent deployments
- Technology agnosticism between parts (e.g., Vue + React)
- Better separation of concerns

The challenge? Stitching them together effectively.
